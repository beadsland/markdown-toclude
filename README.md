toclude
=======

Atom extension to transclude list items into markdown files

Status
======

This extension, when complete, will provide for transclusion of list items into markdown files from arbitrary sources, with an option to truncate such lists when appropriate.

The goal is to allow for prepending TODO lists across related projects, such that a single master task list can be used as an overall project plan.
